    <h3>Notes</h3>
    This Dark Web Pharma Framework (DWPF) Investigative Tool was created using the open-source OSINT Framework by Justin Nordine (https://github.com/lockfale/osint-framework).
    <br> DWPIT leverages the OSINT framework by collecting information from several free sources and tools resources to aid pharmacutical investigators as they conduct investigations relating to the dark web and COVID-19 product being either advertised or sold on the Dark Web.
    <br> Ultimately, the goal is to help investigators navigate the Dark Web with these free Tool resources.
    <h3>Suggestions</h3>
    I am open to improving this framework and welcome any comments, suggestions, or feedback. Kindly connect with me on Twitter at @fopoku_boateng or email me at francisca.opoku-boateng@dsu.edu
