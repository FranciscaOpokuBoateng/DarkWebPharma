    <h3>Notes</h3>
    This Dark Web Pharma Framework (DWPF) Investigative Tool was created using the open-source OSINT Framework by Justin Nordine (https://github.com/lockfale/osint-framework).
    <br> DWPIT leverages the OSINT framework from several free sources and tools resources to aid investigators as they conduct investigations relating to the dark web. 
    <br> Specifically, COVID-19 product being either advertised or sold on the Dark Web. Ultimately, the goal is to help investigators navigate the Dark Web with these free Tool.
